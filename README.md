# WCAG Working Examples: Common Accessibility Issues & Success Criteria

This repository contains **my explanations and working examples** related to the [WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) Success Criteria. The examples demonstrate **common accessibility issues** and how to meet or fail specific WCAG requirements.

Some examples are adapted from reputable accessibility sources (and cited), while others are based on **real-world issues I've observed during accessibility audits and testing**.

The examples are primarily written in **HTML with some CSS/JS** because:
- HTML is the **foundation** of the web and most accessibility issues stem from markup and structure.
- It allows clear demonstration of semantics, focus management, ARIA usage, and form labelingâ€”core to many WCAG criteria.
- These examples are **framework-agnostic** and easy to understand, copy, and test with assistive technologies.
